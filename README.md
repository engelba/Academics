# Academics

Welcome to this repository! Here I store (almost) all of my academics projects. If a project has no code, it maybe for various reason:
- I've lost the code
- Some of the code was made by someone else
- I don't want to show the code

The projects are organized by courses.

Feel free to pick things you found interesting, but be careful to not reuse my code for assignments :)
